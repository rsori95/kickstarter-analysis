# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this experiment was to give Louise a history of previous Kickstarter projects, and their outcomes. This data, ideally, should be able to inform her approach when seeking funding through Kickstarter for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As you can see by the chart, Louise should aim for May or June to launch her project for the best chance to succeed. There is a direct correlation between successful campaign launches and those months in the middle of the year. Whereas there are no correlations to be found for the cancelled or failed projects,

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

There is a very clear trend here - the higher the goal, the less successful. The conclusion to draw from this is that Louise should place the lowest fundraising goal possible, while still staying realistic to what she wants to accomplish and will need for her play.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no difficulties encountered on my end. Some issues one may come across would be just filtering through the amount of data available, it can be overwhelming when you first pull up the sheet to find thousands of line items, however once you begin to dissect it by what's relevant for your purposes, it becomes much easier to get a clear picture.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The middle of year months (May, June, July) are the best ones to launch your Kickstarter campaign. The absolute worst time would be at the end of the year and right at the beginning.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The conclusion to draw from this data is that Louise show aim low with her goal. Obviously still remaining true to what she needs to accomplish, but also being conscious of the fact that there is a direct correlation between low goals and success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The major limitation would be that this dataset does not account for an extremely important factor - the content of the project. Doing a deepdive on Kickstarter play projects would be very telling, and while this seems more like qualitative rather than quantitative data, it doesn't necessarily have to be. If Louise is, for example, doing a comedy, breaking the dataset up by genre would be really helpful.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Pie graphs can very useful to visualize data - for example, a pie chart to break up outcomes across the board for theater projects.
