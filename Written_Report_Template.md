# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this experiment was to give Louise a history of previous Kickstarter projects, and their outcomes. This data, ideally, should be able to inform her approach when seeking funding through Kickstarter for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

As you can see by the chart, Louise should aim for May or June to launch her project for the best chance to succeed. There is a direct correlation between successful campaign launches and those months in the middle of the year. Whereas there are no correlations to be found for the cancelled or failed projects,

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
